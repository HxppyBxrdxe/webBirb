        <img class="IrohaPicLap" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HxppyBxrdxe/webBirb/refs/heads/main/img/photos/ILikeIroha.jpg" alt="I like Iroha">
        <p>Ahh... <a href="https://bluearchive.fandom.com/wiki/Natsume_Iroha" target="_blank">Natsume Iroha</a> from Blue Archive. I love her to bits and she's my favourite character in all of fiction.</p>
        <p>Yap session incomming:</p>
        <p>If I was to get started on a certain character that I particularly enjoy, you know who. Wait, do you? I just wanna give you a reminder. Her name is Natsume Iroha, and she's a tank Commander from Gehenna, which is like this region in Kivotos. Wait, do you even know where that is? Well, its fictional, from this game called Blue Archive. She's like, my favourite character in all of fiction and it hurts me to know that she is merely fictional. But anyway, I'm talking about her, not my woes. Her woes are actually her boss Makoto because she's flipping stupid and makes big mistakes that Iroha has to clean afterwards, and it causes her unnecessary stress that I will feel later on knowing that she had it. Her hobbies include slacking off, which is just like me. she also likes to play games, and has a knock off Nintendo in her room because of like, copyright or whatever. Well, her room is more of a hideout she made in a bunker but whatever, it's cosy. She likes snack, such as crisps, but I don't like the flavour, wasabi. I don't like spicy food that much. I guess she's just more resilient than me and that makes me impressed. She is so cool, the way she just rolls into battle on her tank called Toramaru. Its a Tiger H1. I know it because I'm trying to get it in another game, and have her tank as well. It will never be the original, but I should understand that it's hers. So, I'll stat by discussing her appearance. you know. She's a rather short person who's about 151 cm or 4.11 for those silly Americans out there. But her hair nearly reaches the floor, her puffy pink hair that just looks like a blanket waiting to be held. But whatever. She has a nice sky blue halo which is in the shape of a circle, with a few triangles extending off it, and a large Diamond shape. She has this cool cap which matches her outfit, which is a basic coat with the emblem of Gehenna on the left arm. Her outfit also includes a very long red tie, which is a unique aspect, there is no one else I've ever seen wear it so loosely. Under the jacket, she wears a dark grey shirt, where one end is lapped over her skirt, while the other end is tucked away neatly, which is more of a causal fit, but still clean enough that she went to a ball without needing to change and I think that it's kinda badass! She doesn't care about dress etiquette, but I would really like to see her in a different outfit too, maybe like, a Christmas one, or some summer themed one. Wait, you just know her basic stuff. But like, what about her favourite gift? You know that she really likes reading, so it's a good idea to give books, and magazines. She doesn't like to work too much, well I've explained that. She spends all her events in-game with you just relaxing when she knows she's supposed to bring you over to her boss. She even suggested being a bit, flirty in a way, but she says it's stupid, which I respect because that shows she understands feeling, and what is uncomfortable. Here's some Trivia. Iroha in Kanji is either coloured leaves or coloured feathers. </p>
